# Off-Screen-Window-Retriever
Off-Screen Window Retriever - A Windows console application to reposition windows that are stuck off-screen and are unable to be moved by hand.

This program will reposition the targeted window to [x=0, y=0]. This is useful if the window is "stuck" off-screen (e.g. if you've unplugged an external monitor and the desktop didn't adjust for some reason). Sometimes it is annoying if you are forced to close & re-open the application.
